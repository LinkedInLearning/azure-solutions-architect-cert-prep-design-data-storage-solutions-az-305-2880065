# Azure Solutions Architect Cert Prep: Design Data Storage Solutions (AZ-305)
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Azure Solutions Architect Cert Prep: Design Data Storage Solutions (AZ-305). The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository does not have any branches. Download the entire repository and you get the demo environments and other setups to look at, all in their final state.

Each folder top level folder corresponds to a chapter, then a folder underneath to a video with files specific to that video. The naming convention is CHAPTER#_MOVIE#. As an example, the folder named 02_03 corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.

Within each folder is a chapterX.md file, this contains the commands to be run in the cloudshell to create each environment. The environments allow you to follow along with the videos.

## Installing
These files are designed to be run in Azure Cloudshell. You do not require anything installed locally to use these files.  However, if you would like to study the files locally I recommend the following:

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Add the following extensions to VS Code:
   - [Azure Bicep Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep)
   - [Azure CLI Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azurecli)

To use the files in Azure Cloudshell, clone the repository within the cloudshell, CD to the appropriate directory for your video and execute the commands from the chapterX.md file at the cloudshell command line. For help with Cloudshell, checkout the [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart)
